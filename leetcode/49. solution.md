# Intuition
We have to figure out how to store the anagrams somewhere somehow from the array. For that we will just check every word, then sort that word and use it as a key for a hashmap that will contain the different combinations of those letters.
Hence Map<K, V> where key is any word sorted/ordered and the value is an array of words that fit the key anagram.

# Approach
The most complicated part is know how to group the anagrams together, hence we will be using a (hash) map for it. Afterwards we will use DFS to work with our map and lastly we will push all our anagrams from the hashmap into the response array.

# Code
```
function groupAnagrams(strs: string[]): string[][] {
    //edge case for an empty string
    if(strs.length === 0) return [[""]]
    //array we will be returning
    const res: string[][] = []
    //hashmap we will be using to keep track of anagrams
    const map = new Map()

    //DFS start
    while(strs.length > 0) {
        //get curr
        const curr: string = strs.shift()!
        //sort it out and we will use this as keys (anagrams have the same key)
        const currSort = [...curr].sort().join('')
        //check if an anagram exists of the current element
        //if it doesn't then make a new key for it
        if(!map.has(currSort)) {
            map.set(currSort, [curr])
        } else {
            //if an anagram already exists get the array of elements pertaining to that anagram
            const mapCurrArr = map.get(currSort)
            //push the current element to this anagram
            mapCurrArr.push(curr)
            //set the keys again
            map.set(currSort, mapCurrArr)
        }
    }

    //push all the values (per key) of the map into the res array
    map.forEach((e: string[]) => res.push(e))

    return res
}
```
